# Performance Evaluation

This program evaluates the performance of the Deuces hand evaluator. It reads a list of hands and boards from the `hands_and_boards.csv` file, evaluates each hand, and writes the results to `go_results.txt`.

It also generates a CPU profile named `cpu_profile.prof` that can be used to analyze the performance of the code.

## How to Run

To run the performance evaluation, navigate to this directory and use the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```
